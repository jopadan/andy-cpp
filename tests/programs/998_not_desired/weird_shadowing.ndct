// This should probably throw an error that x needs to be declared prior to declaring foo (or should it?)
fn foo() {
    x = x + 1;
    return x;
}

// Because x is defined before we call foo this example works, but I'm not convinced this is desirable behavior
x := 3;

print(foo());

// Because this x shadows the previous x it doesn't affect the next print statement which makes some sense but not too much
x := 10;
