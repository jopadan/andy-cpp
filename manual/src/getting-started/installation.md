# Installation

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Rust** and **Cargo** installed on your system. If not, you can install them by following the instructions at [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/).

## Installing

To install **Andy C++** using Cargo, run the following command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/timfennis/andy-cpp
```

This will compile Andy C++ and install it into your [Cargo bin directory](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/index.html) (usually located at `$HOME/.cargo/bin`).
