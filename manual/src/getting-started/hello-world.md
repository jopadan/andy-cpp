# Hello, World!

Now that the Andy C++ interpreter is installed we can write our first program.

First create a file called `hello.ndc` add the code in Listing 1-1.

```ndc
print("Hello, world!");
```

In Andy C++ we don't need main function and semicolons are mandatory just like they are in Rust. If you already know Rust, Andy C++ will feel very familiar.

```bash
$ ndc hello.ndc
Hello, world!
```

Now if you're already familiar with Rust and Python, or just C-style languages in general you can checkout the [overview](./overview.md) to get an idea of what the language is like.
