# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for **Andy C++**!

This language is the result of a hobby project that I've poured a lot of time and effort into, purely for the fun of exploring new ideas in programming.  I was inspired to create this language by [Brian Chen](https://github.com/betaveros), who developed [Noulith](https://github.com/betaveros/noulith) to participate in (and ultimately win) Advent of Code. I’d like to thank Brian for the inspiration his work provided.

To enhance clarity and minimize errors in this documentation, I used AI assistance, hoping it would make the language’s concepts easier to understand. Thank you for checking out Andy C++—I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
